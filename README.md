# Dave's Journal for VS Code

A journalling extension for VS Code.
The existing VS Code journalling extensions didn't work exactly how I wanted so I built
my own. This package is really only intended for my own use.
It is unlikely that this will ever be useful for anyone else.
But Microsoft make publishing this in the market-place the most convenient way to get
it installed on all of my machines.

Consider using instead:
[VS Code Journal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pajoma.vscode-journal).
